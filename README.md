This repository contains a collection of algorithm implementations, created as part of our lab exercises. Each lab focuses on a unique algorithmic technique, ranging from recursive and iterative methods to divide and conquer, as well as greedy algorithms. These exercises aim to provide hands-on experience with different problem-solving strategies.
list of labs:-
1.Binary Search Tree Insertion
2.Merge Sort and Quick Sort
3.Matrix Multiplication
4.Activity Selection Problem
5.Matrix Chain Multiplication 
6.Shortest Path Algorithms
7.0/1 Knapsack Problem - Greedy vs Dynamic Programming
